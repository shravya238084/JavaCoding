Time Complexity
   --> The rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size
   --> represented by using O ()
   --> 3 rules  --> Always compute Time complexity for the worst case scenario
                -->avoid constants
                -->avoid lower values
      Big O                           Theta                           Omega
       O()
upper Bound / Worst case           Average complexity            Best case / Lower bound

Space complexity
   -->Its memory space taken by program to execute 
   --> Auxilary space (space taken to solve the program )   +  
   input space(space taken to store the input)
